## About

The Java Chess Game is a simple, console-based chess game developed as a learning project. It aims to help understand Java basics, Object-Oriented Programming concepts, and game logic. You can play the game against a friend locally, making it a fun way to practice both chess and Java.

## Key Features

♟️ **Standard Chess Rules**: Play a classic game of chess following all the standard rules.<br>
🤖 **Two-Player Mode**: Challenge a friend to a game on the same machine.<br>
💡 **Learning Opportunity**: The project is designed to be simple yet educational for Java beginners.<br>
🕹️ **Command-Line Interface**: Simple text-based interface to move pieces and play the game.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To play the game, ensure you have the following installed:

- Java JDK 11 or later

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/JavaChessGame.git
   cd JavaChessGame
   
```

2. Compile the Java files:

```bash
   javac -d bin -sourcepath src src/main/Main.java
   
```

3. Run the game:

```bash
   java -cp bin main.Main
   
```

## Gameplay

Once the game starts, players will be prompted to enter their moves in standard chess notation.

- **Commands**: Use standard chess notation like "e2 e4" to move a piece from one square to another.
- **Objective**: Capture the opponent's king to win the game.
- **Rules**: All standard chess rules apply, including castling, en passant, and pawn promotion.
